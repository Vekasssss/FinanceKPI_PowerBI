4. Yummies achieved the targets as 3 agents were in Top 5 revenue generators 
5. Bottom 5 agents list has been provided on the dashboard
6. Overall we have acheived the targets only for 2 months - March 2023 & July 2023

Suggestions 
* The 2% shortfall in target can be acheived if we concentrate on bottom 5 agents by giving proper feedback and support
* While YoY revenue saw a slight growth, but its still on lower part if considered indusrty standard. We can work on training bottom performer and introduce the perks and incentives to agents who acheived targets
* Delish, Juices and Tempo teams to be held accountable for the agents who failed to meet the targets and arrange proper traning and other metrices as per SOP
* Monthy target perofmance is poor. To imporve, please manage daily produtivity and targets
* Gunar cockshoot to be awarded for the acheivement and will set example for other agents with +ve motivation.
